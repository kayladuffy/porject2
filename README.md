Here is my Giphy Search Webpage. Title and search are side by side for desktop; stacked for mobile view. I only styled for the required 320px mobile view, per the project instructions. Nav bar is also side by side desktop; stacked mobile (they do not link anywhere). Same with gifs returned. 

Styled using SASS and Flexbox. API key included to ensure smooth keyword search. 

Technologies: HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, jQuery, JSON

Ideas for future improvement: 
1. Style returned gifs more uniformed
2. Implement appropriate styling for all screen sizes by adding more media queries and style, as needed. 
3. Adding a gif count option so that user can choose how many gifs are returned in any given search.
